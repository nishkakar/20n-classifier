<p>Ambush Bug is a superhero who has mental problems that prevent him from truly understanding reality around him, so even his true identity might be no more than a delusion on his part. He appears only in "Mitefall", where he tries to stop Bat-Mite from getting <i>Brave and the Bold</i> cancelled. Despite his valiant efforts, the show is cancelled, but he manages to get together most of the characters for a goodbye party in the Batcave. He also appears to Bat-Mite to inform him that his actions will result in the end of his own existence, as Bat-Mite is too silly a character for a dark and gritty Batman series.</p>

<p>Aquaman, also known as Arthur Curry, is the ruler of <a href="/wiki/Atlantis_(DC_Comics)" title="Atlantis (DC Comics)">Atlantis</a>, and a superhero. This is the mostly friendly, boisterous, happy-go-lucky incarnation of the hero. He is old friends with Batman. Aquaman first appears in "Evil Under the Sea!", where his older brother Orm hires assassin Black Manta to kill him. After Manta fails, Orm becomes the Ocean Master, and attacks his brother. Batman rescues Aquaman and they work together to defeat Black Manta. Though upset by his brother's betrayal, he refuses to give up on him because they are family. In "Journey to the Center of the Bat!", Aquaman works with the Atom in order to cure Batman of a virus, and shrinks down inside Batman's body to stop it. Aquaman later joins other heroes in "Game Over for Owlman!", in order to hunt down Batman, mistakenly wanted for Owlman's crimes. He is captured by Owlman, who tries to kill him by drying him out. He is saved by a high tech, futuristic Batman and helps defeat Black Manta. In "Mystery In Space!" he inadvertently joins Batman on a mission to the planet Rann to help Adam Strange battle the Gordanians when they try to conquer the planet. Aquaman is seen as depressed, after failing to save a beluga whale from a group of whalers. After recovering from his melancholy, he comes up with a plan to defeat the Gordanians, by having Batman teleport Earth's <a href="/wiki/Moon" title="Moon">moon</a> to Rann. In "Mayhem of the Music Meister!", Aquaman is one of three heroes who run afoul of the title villain and are hypnotically compelled to sing and obey the villains' commands. In "The Fate of Equinox!" one of the powers Batman gets is Aquaman's. In "Aquaman's Outrageous Adventure!", Aquaman and his family are on a road trip and eventually save Batman from The Penguin. In "Sidekicks Assemble!", Aquaman teams up with Batman and Green Arrow to battle Ra's al Ghul. In "The Criss Cross Conspiracy!" Aquaman help Batman and the Atom to battle the Bug-Eyed Bandit. He joins the Justice League International in "Darkseid Descending!". In "Mitefall," Aquaman helps Batman and Ambush Bug fight Gorilla Grodd only for the battle to be disrupted when Bat-Mite plans to cancel the series. During this time, Aquaman's voice changes during Bat-Mite's plot. He had also had the status as a <a href="/wiki/Breakout_character" title="Breakout character" class="mw-redirect">breakout character</a> throughout the series, which Bat-Mite makes no 4th-wall breaking assumptions over in the said episode.</p>

<p>The current Atom is a superhero and friend of Batman. His secret identity is that of physicist Dr. Ryan Choi, a serious and calculating man. He helps Batman defeat the evil sorcerer Felix Faust. In "Journey to the Center of the Bat!", The Atom and Aquaman team up, shrink themselves, and enter Batman's body in order to fight a deadly virus (a parody of the classic body-spelunking cliche, à la <i><a href="/wiki/Fantastic_Voyage" title="Fantastic Voyage">Fantastic Voyage</a></i>). Although they initially dislike one another, The Atom and Aquaman eventually bond and succeed in their mission. In "Game Over for Owlman!" The Atom and other heroes hunt down Batman after being deceived by Owlman into believing that he had committed several crimes. Owlman and his allies eventually capture The Atom, along with a number of other heroes, and subject him to a device designed to kill him through use of an accelerated lead atom. The Atom is eventually freed by a western styled Batman and, in the ensuing melee, helps defeat Doctor Polaris. He makes a cameo appearance in "Aquaman's Outrageous Adventure!" battling the Bug-Eyed Bandit on Aquaman's windshield before the windshield wipers wipe them off. In "Sword of the Atom," Ryan Choi had retired from being Atom when Aquaman comes to him at the time when Chronos has returned. Ryan and Aquaman go to South America where Batman went missing looking for Ray Palmer. After helping to defeat Chancellor Deraegis, Ryan returns to being Atom while Ray remains in the Amazon. Ryan even manages to defeat Chronos.</p>

He is driven by guilt and revenge following the murder of his parents as a child. Batman spent his youth training in a plethora of fighting styles including boxing under Wildcat and Chinese martial arts under Wu Fei. During his training in the latter Batman met future ally Bronze Tiger and future foes Fox, Vulture, and Shark.</p>
<p>Batman is perhaps best known for the explicit emphasis he places on mental training and intelligence. He couples this with his parents' vast fortune, allowing him to create many advanced gadgets and vehicles. Though usually grim and serious, he is willing to work with others in order to foil villains but prefers to work alone. His close friends include Green Arrow, Blue Beetle, The Atom, Red Tornado, Aquaman, Plastic Man and B'Wana Beast. Wildcat was the one who trained him in the art of boxing. When undercover, he uses his <a href="/wiki/Matches_Malone" title="Matches Malone" class="mw-redirect">Matches Malone</a> identity.</p>
<p>The episode "Deep Cover for Batman!" reveals that Batman has an evil counterpart in an alternate universe. Going by the name <a href="/wiki/Owlman_(comics)" title="Owlman (comics)">Owlman</a>, Batman's <a href="/wiki/Doppelg%C3%A4nger" title="Doppelgänger">doppelgänger</a> has succeeded in capturing the heroes of his world and in becoming the ruler—or at least co-ruler alongside other villains—as a result. In the following episode "Game Over for Owlman!", Batman travels to other alternate Earths and recruits other versions of himself.</p>
<p>When Batman is killed, Phantom Stranger assembles Nightwing, Jason Todd, Tim Drake, Damian Wayne, Stephanie Brown, and Carrie Kelly to resurrect Batman. Nightwing makes inspections on the other Robins and makes a comment on Jason and Damian's brutal fighting styles and Tim's detective skills. When Jason tries to leave, Damian threatens him by saying he will make his future happen a lot sooner. Additionally, Damian makes a jab about girls not being able to be Robin which is a reference to Stephanie's short tenure as Robin. The Robins then take Batman to the League of Assassins HQ to put Batman in the Lazarus Pit. While Tim and Stephanie stand guard, the others go inside until they are found out by the League. Ra's al Ghul arrives and lets them use the pit, not wanting Batman to die such an ignorable death. But Ra's hoped that the pit would drive Batman insane and kill the Robins, but Batman returns to normal.</p>

In his youth, Dick Grayson worked as a circus acrobat alongside his parents until the day they were tragically killed in an acrobatic accident. Still a mere boy, Dick found a home with Batman's alter-ego, Bruce Wayne. Eventually, he learned of the Caped Crusader's secret and donned a costume of his own. The partnership would not last, however, and when he got older the two went their separate ways. Nevertheless, the Dynamic Duo team up in "The Color of Revenge!" following <a href="/wiki/Crazy_Quilt" title="Crazy Quilt">Crazy Quilt</a>'s targeting of Robin. In the episode Robin claimed to have left due to the lack of respect, and throughout the episode demands that Batman give him the respect he deserves (Batman claiming that he respected him enough to believe that he was capable of watching over Bludhaven on his own). Together they stop Crazy Quilt. Robin temporarily re-partnered with Batman to foil Killer Moth's hijack attempt on the Gotham Bank Money Train. In "Sidekicks Assemble!" Robin teams up with Speedy and Aqualad to battle against Ra's al Ghul and Talia, in the hopes of proving to their mentors that they deserve proper respect as superheros. At the end of the episode, Dick gives up the Robin identity and becomes Nightwing (Batman suggesting the name for him at that time), wearing the original 'disco' style costume. In "Requiem for a Scarlet Speedster!" Kid Flash tells Batman to say hi to Nightwing.</p>

<p>In this show, Batwoman is <b>Katrina Moldoff</b>, the heiress to the Moldoff Circus fortune. She is portrayed as a thrill seeker and a trained circus acrobat whom Batman dislikes due to her crime fighting occasionally endangering innocent bystanders. In the past, she helped Batman and Robin fight the Riddler only to have her mask ripped off and her identity to be exposed to a group of reporters on the scene. As a result, she was prohibited from fighting crime by the courts and spent the subsequent years later living incognito. Some years later, Katrina hears that the Riddler has escaped from prison. She visits Felix Faust's magic shop to obtain a spell to swap her body with Batman in order to work around her court-ordered inactivity and get revenge on the Riddler. Batman (in Katrina's body) is forced to assume the role of Batwoman in order to reverse the spell even bringing along Felix Faust along for the ride. However, Katrina is captured and almost killed by the Riddler, but is saved by Batman, Nightwing, Batgirl, and Felix Faust. She learns her lesson and goes along quietly to pay her debt to society. After Batwoman is loaded into the paddy wagon, Felix Faust shows some romance toward her even though Batman was in her body.</p>

After Batman and Wildcat infiltrate their underground headquarters and defeat their monstrous leader, Slug, Black Lightning uses his electricity to save Wildcat's life, with instruction from Katana, to jumpstart the elder's heart when he suffers a cardiac arrest. He is seen at the end of the episode boxing with Wildcat. In the teaser for "Duel of the Double Crossers!", he reveals that he has an <a href="/wiki/Afro" title="Afro">afro</a>-style haircut underneath his hood. In the episode "Inside the Outsiders!", when Batman entered Black Lightning's mind to stop Psycho-Pirate from feeding off his rage, it is revealed that Lightning is easily enraged by even the most inane and inconsequential things, like someone putting sprinkles in his coffee ("What are you, six?!").

<p>The lone female in the Outsider's trio, she has no super powers, but is a highly skilled martial artist and swordswoman. Katana is generally silent (stating to her friends that "you know how I hate to repeat myself"), typically letting her actions speak for her. After Batman and Wildcat convince her and the Outsiders to turn against their monstrous boss Slug, Wildcat suffers from a heart attack causing Katana to take charge of the situation and speak. She instructs Black Lightning to jumpstart Wildcats heart while Metamorpho becomes oxygen to fill his lungs in order to revive him. She is later seen at Wildcat's gym dumping out one of his 'Tiger Tonic's (composed of tuna, bananas, raw eggs and Tabasco sauce) into a nearby house plant (Batman did this earlier in the episode, and the plant died instantly). Her appearance is that of a teenage Japanese girl in a red skirt and yellow shirt (both reference the adult version's costume in colour), two shurikens in her hair and she always carries a sword with her. In "Inside the Outsiders!", Katana and the rest of the Outsiders are captured by Psycho Pirate, and her nightmare is re-living the night her master is killed. In "The Siege of Starro! Part One", she wore a samurai costume. In "Requiem for a Scarlet Speedster!", she is seen in the classic costume her adult version wears, and she (and the rest of the outsiders) stop Kobra.</p>

His unique abilities apparently require lots of energy, as he is seen almost constantly eating during the show. At the end of the episode he is seen at Wildcat's gym heartily drinking down Wildcat's Tiger Tonic. In "Inside the Outsiders, Psycho Pirate captures the Outsiders and makes them live their nightmares.

After Batman helped him get parole, he became Plastic Man, and has tried to redeem himself by being a hero. However, he still has urges to steal money whenever he has the chance. Plastic Man and Batman team up to fight Gentleman Ghost and Gorilla Grodd. Batman is doubtful of Plastic Man's redemption and his criminal urges but grows to trust him after Plastic Man lobs the gold he stole at Grodd to save him.</p>
<p>Plastic Man and Elongated Man later team up to fight Baby Face, while arguing who Batman likes better, an argument that gets them tangled up together.</p>
<p>He joins the other heroes in hunting down Batman when Owlman, disguised as him, frames him. Despite the fact that the other heroes do not really want his help (Green Arrow said to him "And no, O'Brian, your assistance is not required"), he comes closer to actually catching Batman than anyone else (though Batman escapes). He later helps a psychic-Batman from an alternate universe stop the Brain by distracting him. Plastic Man is portrayed as a mostly ineffectual character in the series, and has a mixed relationship with Batman; although Batman is annoyed by the awkward behavior of O'Brian, they are shown to be good friends and Batman often helps and advises "Plas" concerning his mistakes.</p>
<p>He is married to a woman called Ramona, who appears to be rather unsupportive and cynical of his pursuit of justice. They also have a baby son.</p>

He can project tornadoes from his arms and legs, having great control over them, also being a robot, he can be destroyed and rebuilt if need be. In the episode "Invasion of the Secret Santas!", Red Tornado tries to understand the spirit of Christmas, while helping Batman stop Fun Haus's holiday crime spree. Red Tornado destroys Fun Haus's giant robot and defeats the villain, but his body is destroyed due to an overload. However, shortly before exploding, he finally experiences the "tingling sensation" that he believes to be Christmas Spirit. His pieces are picked up by hazmat scientists and taken to be rebuilt at S.T.A.R. Labs. He appears in "Game Over for Owlman!". When Owlman framed Batman by posing as him, Red Tornado was among those hunting Batman only to be caught in a trap set by Owlman.

Despite the fact that he claims to have no human emotion, the ending of the episode sees him shed a tear at the loss of his son, though it seems Red Tornado does not understand what this means (he stated that it was 'oily discharge').

<p>A crime fighter from a bygone era who originally taught Batman how to box, as seen sparring with Batman at the start of the episode. Wildcat is a gruff and feisty crime fighter who is slightly depressed that no one wants to come and learn boxing from him nowadays. He helps Batman in his fight against the Outsiders when they attack a shopping mall, and are apparently working for a gross mutant named Slug. They later find Slug's hideout, but ended up captured and are about to be fed to his giant mutant snapper turtles. Due to trash talking, Slug released Wildcat, but left Batman for the giant turtles in a deep pit. Wildcat fought against Slug while Batman escaped the pit. Wildcat defeated him and threw him in the toxic waste-filled river, which mutated him into an even larger, tentacled freak. Wildcat managed to convince the Outsiders not to consider themselves freaks, saying that he used to be an 'outsider' when he was younger. When Slug emerged from the polluted river, the Outsiders joined Batman in defeating him when Wildcat suffered a heart attack. With advice from Katana, Black Lightning and Metamorpho reactivated Wildcat's heart. Wildcat later trains the Outsiders in boxing. Wildcat later helps Batman fight Bane at the beginning of "Menace of the Conqueror Caveman!" He mentions that he has "4 lives left"; if that is correct, then he has already died 5 other times, plus the heart attack in this episode. This may be a reference to his superpower in the comics, which was having literally nine lives. It is unknown if he was joking or if this incarnation has that power. In The Golden Age of Justice!, is revealed to be a member of the Justice Society (a superhero team from the Golden Age that mentored both Batman and Black Canary in the ways of crimefighting).

When confronted by the current Black Canary about how they treat her like a child, Wildcat tells her about how her mother died in a fire when the Justice Society were rescuing people from a burning building. As part of her dying wish, Wildcat vowed to take care of her daughter. Reminded of her mother Wildcat realizes it is time he started treating her like an adult and the two team up to help Batman and the rest of the Justice Society fight the Society's old enemy, Per Degaton. During the battle, Per Degaton timewrapping staff briefly reverts Wildcat and the Justice Society to their younger-selves. With help from Batman, Black Canary, Wildcat and the Justice Society defeat Per Degaton and his minions.</p>

<p>A mysterious villain obsessed with balance who tried to kill the Question and Gorilla Grodd as a part of life's goal to bring balance to society. Managed to escape Batman, foreshadowing his return in a later episode. Although he tried to destroy a villain to restore balance to the world he needed to destroy the Question to make sure that the power of good did not overpower the forces of evil. This makes him slightly neutral of villainy but is still considered a villain. What makes him odd is that he fell from atop a building into an alleyway, yet survived. Before he fell, he said that if Batman was to survive he had to also.</p>
<p>He starts a fight between Shrapnel and OMAC in "When OMAC Attack!" This time, he demonstrates reality-bending powers, such as turning Batarangs into real-life bats. After Batman sacrifices himself to deactivate a nuclear reactor, Equinox bring him back to life, stating that his death would unbalance the universe.</p>
<p>In "The Fate of Equinox!", it is revealed that the Lords of Chaos and Order gave him the magics of both light and dark when he was a baby and taught him, in order to allow balance, so that neither side could become more powerful. However, the pressure was too great and he snapped, going insane and believing he could do a better job without following his masters and followed a sense of balance that made sense only to his fractured psyche. When he failed to stop the Earth from rotating in order to make one half of the world bright and hot and the other half of the world dark and cold as his eternal example of perfect balance, he was killed but this merely released his spirit, allowing him to absorb the power of his old masters, making him all powerful. He tries to destroy and remake the universe in his own image using this great power. Batman, with the combined powers of Doctor Fate, Aquaman, Black Canary, Black Lightning, Blue Beetle, Fire, Flash I, Green Arrow, Green Lantern, Plastic Man, and Red Tornado bonded with him (causing Plastic Man to dub him Bat Monolith), fought Equinox. At one point it seemed the Bat Monolith had the upper hand putting Equinox on the defensive, but Equinox appeared to regain the upper hand. Bat Monolith found a way to defeat him when he made Equinox realize he was not in perfect balance because he hated his old masters, the magic of Chaos and Order inside him caused Equinox to begin to crack. Bat Monolith took the opportunity and punched Equinox into the energy he was preparing to destroy the universe with, destroying Equinox forever, or so it seemed.</p>
<p>Equinox, in a sense, returned in "Time Out For Vengeance". It was revealed that when Bat Monolith destroyed Equinox, he shattered Equinox body and mind into twelve fragments across time and space. The part of Equinox that represented his hate and thirst for vengeance found its way into a supercomputer. There, he commissioned squadrons of robots infused with his essence, and sent them across time to eliminate the Batmen of different time periods. Almost immediately, Batman dissolved into thin air, and Rex Hunter arrived at the Justice League station to tell them the bad news. He, Martian Manhunter, and the rest of the Justice League International set out to save the Batmen of the past; Guy Gardner and Ice rescue a caveman Batman, Booster Gold and Blue Beetle rescue the Batman of pirate ages, and Fire and Aquaman go to the Roman Empire to save the Batman there. However, past and present in this universe occur at the same time, and events of the future can also affect the present. When the robot Batman of Equinox's time is captured and tortured, the Justice League returns to find their Batman has not returned, and only Rex and Manhunter can remember anything about him. The entire team, Rex excluded, go to rescue the robot Batman, but the remainder of Equinox's revenge squad is more than a match for them. Robot Batman summons up his will to break free, and an angered Equinox combines his minions into one massive robot, which his mind jumps into. Robot Batman uses his Batarang to overload Equinox's time portal generator, summoning the past Batmen who band together and battle Equinox. Equinox is obliterated, and in his wake his robots vanish and Batman returns to existence. However, the Justice League remembers that Equinox splintered into twelve fragments, and so there is every possibility that he can return.</p>

After Arsenal was defeated, General Zahl arrived in a ship and attacked Batman and the Doom Patrol with knock-out gas. Some minutes later on General Zahl's ship, General Zahl had Chief mention the real reason why the Doom Patrol broke up. It turned out that back in the Doom Patrol's last fight with General Zahl in France, General Zahl held a woman at gunpoint. Though General Zahl was defeated, the woman was killed. Now General Zahl reveals that he had planted two detonators on two nearby islands with the Doom Patrol deciding on which island to save with the choice being televised around the world.

When General Zahl mentions that the actual detonator control is on his hat and activates it, the Doom Patrol are caught in the explosion while Batman used a knock-out gas on the other villains. General Zahl even mourned the Doom Patrol's sacrifice as he and the other villains are later arrested (namely because he failed to reveal them as "frauds" and making the world love them even more, thus disappointing him).</p>

With Batman devolved to an ape, Plastic Man helps the Ape-Batman fight Gorilla Grodd and his servants. When the E-Ray is activated, it evolved the humans (Batman put the E-Ray on reverse when Gorilla Grodd was not looking) back to their natural state. It even evolved Gorilla Grodd to a human who ended up incarcerated at Iron Heights in the end planning his revenge.

<p>The Injustice Syndicate is an alternate Earth's version of the superheroes that Batman has teamed up with. They plotted to blow up Batman's Earth. Among the featured members are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Owlman_(comics)" title="Owlman (comics)">Owlman</a></b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Diedrich_Bader" title="Diedrich Bader">Diedrich Bader</a>): Parallel Dimension's Batman. He is the leader of the Injustice Syndicate. Owlman uses the Phase Oscillator to scout ahead in Batman's dimension before invading it. After a scuffle, the Dark Knight locks him up. They end up switching places when Batman decides to stop the syndicate with Owlman imprisoned in the Batcave's cell. In "Game Over for Owlman!", Owlman escapes and frames Batman by committing various crimes while disguised as him (Owlman's Batman disguise is almost the original 1930s version of Batman's costume, complete with hand only gloves, high wing mask, dark grey bodysuit and black accessories and bright yellow with circle utility belt). Owlman assembles Black Manta, Brain, Clock King, Doctor Polaris, Gentleman Ghost, and Gorilla Grodd to join him. With the heroes after him, Batman teams up with Joker (who was displeased that Owlman was upstaging him). Owlman used Batman's computer to figure out weaknesses to capture Green Arrow, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Red Tornado, Atom, and Aquaman. When they end up captured, he negotiates with Batman to hand him the Phase Oscillator in exchange for their freedom. When it came to the fight with Owlman and his villain allies, Owlman allowed Joker to work on the wax trap. Batman revealed that he travelled to alternate Earths to round up the Batmen to fight the villains and free the captive heroes. Using a smokescreen, Batman managed to get Owlman and Joker trapped in wax. Owlman was returned to his dimension in bondage while the other villains were arrested.</li>
<li><b>Blue Bowman</b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/James_Arnold_Taylor" title="James Arnold Taylor">James Arnold Taylor</a>): Parallel Dimension's Green Arrow. He did not use the typical gimmick arrows used by his Earth counterpart and mainly used lethal varieties with razor sharp tips and explosive edges.

<li><b>Dyna-Mite</b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/James_Sie" title="James Sie">James Sie</a>): Parallel Dimension's Atom. Blue Bowman had him spy on "Owlman!" when he started to act suspicious to the Injustice Syndicate.</li>
<li><b>Scarlet Scarab</b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Will_Friedle" title="Will Friedle">Will Friedle</a>): Parallel Dimension's Blue Beetle. Scarlet Scarab shows <a href="/wiki/Psychotic" title="Psychotic" class="mw-redirect">psychotic</a> tendencies, taking pleasure in terrorizing civilians, and claiming that he keeps the heart of an unnamed hero in a jar in his closet.</li>
<li><b>Silver Cyclone</b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Corey_Burton" title="Corey Burton">Corey Burton</a>): Parallel Dimension's Red Tornado. After the "Injustice Syndicate's" plan to invade Batman world is thwarted (the plan was changed to destroy Batman's world after Batman posed as Owlman), and his teammates are captured, he attempts to set off his bomb (revealed to only affect organic life) on his own world. Silver Cyclone reveals that he hates organic life and wishes to destroy it (in contrast to Red Tornado's desire to learn about and mingle with humanity). Red Hood stopped him by throwing one of his red aces into the side of his head, causing his head to blow up.</li>
