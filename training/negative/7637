<p><b><a href="/wiki/Sergeant" title="Sergeant">Sergeant</a> Gregory "Greg" Parker</b> (<a href="/wiki/Enrico_Colantoni" title="Enrico Colantoni">Enrico Colantoni</a>)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Aside from being the team's Sergeant and leader, he is Team 1's main <a href="/wiki/Negotiation" title="Negotiation">crisis negotiator</a>. As such, he prefers that situations be resolved through dialogue instead of lethal force. He learned the art of negotiation when he was able to survive a hard life under his strict father.<sup id="cite_ref-Greg_Bio_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Greg_Bio-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> He is divorced from his wife and became estranged from his only son, Dean, because he spent too much time with the SRU years ago and he had a drinking problem. As of episode 11 he had just seen his son after eight years,<sup id="cite_ref-Greg_Bio_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Greg_Bio-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> regretting that he did not do so earlier.<sup id="cite_ref-Episode_2_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Episode_2-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Greg cares not only for his team, but for the lives of the innocents and those subjects who are about to make a mistake that will ruin an otherwise good life. He often puts the blame for a failed attempt to save a life solely on himself, something Ed frequently reminds him of.</dd>
<dd>A recurring theme for Greg is that he always reminds his teammates to "keep the peace" during any SRU-led operation.</dd>
<dd>In the two-part series finale, "Keep the Peace", Greg is shot in the leg as he is holding off a mad bomber while trying to defuse his bomb. His leg wound forces him to retire from SRU, and a year later, he is teaching at the police academy.</dd>

<p><b><a href="/wiki/Constable" title="Constable">Constable</a> (later <a href="/wiki/Sergeant" title="Sergeant">Sergeant</a>) Edward "Ed" Lane</b> (<a href="/wiki/Hugh_Dillon" title="Hugh Dillon">Hugh Dillon</a>)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The veteran of the <b>Strategic Response Unit</b> team, he is the team's tactical leader in the field.<sup id="cite_ref-Ed_Bio_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ed_Bio-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Ed's secondary role is to act as the crisis negotiator in direct contact with the subject(s). Though he has been trained to use lethal force, Ed is constantly troubled with the fact that he sometimes needs to use it to save the lives of others.<sup id="cite_ref-Ed_Bio_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ed_Bio-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>
<dd>He has some problems with his wife of fifteen years, Sophie, and son Clark due to the nature of his job,<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> and the fact that he is strongly attached to his SRU colleagues. For example, he once deliberately missed the anniversary of his <a href="/wiki/Parent-in-law" title="Parent-in-law">in-laws</a> for work. Since season 4, he also has a daughter Isabelle.<sup id="cite_ref-Episode_1_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Episode_1-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>
<dd>In Season 5, Ed is forced to shoot a teenage girl to stop her from killing her abusive father holding her mother at gunpoint. Though he justifies that he was only following protocol, deep down he feels guilt for taking the shot. In "Sons of the Father", the girl's mother expresses willingness to forgive him, but he refuses to accept her forgiveness. In "Forget Oblivion", Ed starts seeing the girl when he succeeds at target practice. He subsequently gets a psychologist in "Fit for Duty", who helps him sort through the guilt. After the events of "Keep the Peace", Ed is promoted to Sergeant after a leg wound forces Greg to retire from SRU (as seen in the flash-forward).</dd>

<p><b><a href="/wiki/Constable" title="Constable">Constable</a> Julianna "Jules" Callaghan</b> (<a href="/wiki/Amy_Jo_Johnson" title="Amy Jo Johnson">Amy Jo Johnson</a>)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Before Leah joined the team, Jules was the only woman and the sign outside the women's locker room read 'Jules' rather than 'Women'. In the later episodes of season two as well as in select other episodes, Jules often acts as an intelligence gatherer alongside Sgt. Parker. This role is necessary during times in which the subject(s) need to be properly profiled in order for the team to make the proper tactical choice. She's also a backup negotiator, and along with Ed and Sam, she is a trained sniper.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> Prior to her transfer to the SRU, Jules served as an officer with the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police" title="Royal Canadian Mounted Police">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Jules_Bio_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Jules_Bio-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> Jules has 4 brothers and mentioned in one episode that she was from Medicine Hat, Alberta.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Jules was shot by a sniper during the season one finale, and was in the hospital for several weeks/episodes during the second season. During her period of recovery, she was briefly replaced on Team One by Constable Donna Sabine, played by <a href="/wiki/Jessica_Steen" title="Jessica Steen">Jessica Steen</a>, who upon the return of Jules transferred to another team within the SRU which eventually led her to become the leader of Team 3.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Sam has been attracted to Jules ever since his recruitment to the SRU unit and the two of them dated over a period of several episodes, strengthening an already strong protective sense towards each other. It is revealed in the beginning of "Between Heartbeats" that Parker knows they are in a relationship, leading to a conversation where they discuss their future together versus the their future in the team. The conversation is cut short, and later, when Jules is shot, Sam is devastated. When the rogue sniper takes Ed hostage, Sam is the one who makes the kill shot. He rushes to the hospital, where he holds her hand and cries saying he should've protected her. When Jules returns to the team after being shot, she breaks up with him, saying that they "can't keep breaking the rules forever". She broke up with him so that they could both stay with the 'family' (SRU Team 1), knowing that if their relationship was ever exposed one of them would have to transfer. In particular, Jules didn't like the idea of sneaking around behind the backs of their friends and teammates.<sup id="cite_ref-Jules_Bio_10-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Jules_Bio-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> In the Season 4 premiere, it was revealed that Jules and Sam were getting back together because they realized their love for each other "wasn't going to go away" and kissed at Sam's apartment. This revelation was brought about by their intense questioning about their relationship from Dr. Toth, who was performing psychological evaluations in the Season 3 finale. At the end of the Season 4 premiere, Dr. Toth makes it a condition of the team's probation that they keep their relationship strictly professional. Through season 4, they are in a secret relationship that they are keeping hidden from the rest of Team One. In the episode 'The Cost of Doing Business' (4x10) Greg Parker finds out about their relationship and, at the end of the episode, he allows them to keep the relationship a secret provided their attitude doesn't change at work. In 'Priority of Life' (4x17), the work dynamic between Jules and Sam is addressed again when Jules is locked in a room with an armed subject as the confined lab quickly fills with <a href="/wiki/Anthrax" title="Anthrax">Anthrax</a>. Sam has an opportunity to bring an injured hostage or Jules to safety and, choosing to observe the Priority of Life Code, saves the hostage. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to the rest of the team, Greg Parker has been suspended by Dr. Toth for concealing Jules and Sam's relationship. Greg and Dr. Toth watch the code being observed over a video feed, and Dr. Toth later tells Sam he will talk to Commander Holleran and try to allow them to stay on Team One together. At the end of Season 4 they receive the news that they're both allowed to stay on Team One together while being in a relationship. In "We Take Care of Our Own", it is revealed that Jules is pregnant. Jules and Sam get married in "Keep the Peace (Part 1)". In "Keep the Peace (Part 2)", a year later, their daughter Sadie is born.</dd>

<dd>A former <a href="/wiki/Master_Corporal" title="Master Corporal" class="mw-redirect">Master Corporal</a> and ex-special forces operative of <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Joint_Task_Force_2" title="Joint Task Force 2">Joint Task Force 2</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-Sam_Bio_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Sam_Bio-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> Sam joined the SRU unit, replacing the promoted Roland 'Rolie' Cray, after he was involved in <a href="/wiki/Canada%27s_role_in_the_invasion_of_Afghanistan" title="Canada's role in the invasion of Afghanistan" class="mw-redirect">Afghan combat operations</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Episode_1_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Episode_1-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> Due to his experience in Afghanistan, Sam believed that lethal force was the solution instead of using negotiation to resolve situations,<sup id="cite_ref-Episode_3_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Episode_3-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> which some of his colleagues objected to.<sup id="cite_ref-Episode_2_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Episode_2-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Sam_Bio_11-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Sam_Bio-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> His transfer to Team One is received generally well, however, and after training and guidance he becomes a valued member of the team, going out for drinks and joking with the rest of the team. He is also nicknamed "Samtastic' by Spike after he aces his first shooting practice, which was run by Jules. His main role is as a sniper on the team, though he spends some time as tactical leader while Ed recovers from an injury.<sup id="cite_ref-Sam_Bio_11-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Sam_Bio-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> It was revealed in the episode "Acceptable Risk" that he had a younger sister whom he, at the age of nine, witnessed being hit by a car while crossing the street. She died instantly, which has made him extremely protective of members of his team, most notably Jules. In the Season 2 finale <a href="/wiki/Behind_the_Blue_Line" title="Behind the Blue Line" class="mw-redirect">Behind the Blue Line</a>, after the subject who Sam connected with is shot, he says he is quitting SRU, but his teammates show him he is wrong and convince him to remain on Team One.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>He is attracted to Jules from the beginning, and sometimes comes across as overprotective, partly because of his feelings and partly because of her gender (while he's not sexist and he values her skills, his experience watching his sister die has made him particularly protective of women).<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> In season 1 episode 10, he kissed Jules, and offered to drive her home after he realized she blamed herself for the events of the day. After that episode, Sam and Jules are in a relationship which they keep secret since they are not allowed to date because they are on the same team. It is revealed in the beginning of "Between Heartbeats" that Parker knows they are in a relationship, leading to a conversation where they discuss their future together versus the their future in the team. The conversation is cut short, and later, when Jules is shot, Sam is devastated. When the rogue sniper takes Ed hostage, Sam is the one who makes the kill shot. He rushes to the hospital, where he holds her hand and cries saying he should've protected her. When Jules returns to the team after being shot, she breaks up with him, saying that they "can't keep breaking the rules forever". Sam understands, and sadly agrees to end the relationship, but even after the breakup, he is seen flirting with her on various occasions. He is incredibly protective of her and always wants to keep her safe. In the Season 3 finale, he and Jules are questioned by Dr. Toth (a psychological examiner with a specialty in team psychology) about their relationship, which prompts them to realize they still have feelings for each other. In the Season 4 premiere, Jules shows up at his apartment and he tells her that their love "isn't going to go away," and they kiss passionately. At the end of the Season 4 premiere, Dr. Toth makes it a condition of the team's probation that they keep their relationship strictly professional. Through season 4, they are in a secret relationship that they are keeping hidden from the rest of Team One. In the episode 'The Cost of Doing Business' (4x10) Greg Parker finds out about their relationship and, at the end of the episode, he allows them to keep the relationship a secret provided their attitude doesn't change at work. In 'Priority of Life' (4x17), the work dynamic between Jules and Sam is addressed again when Jules is locked in a room with an armed subject as the confined space quickly fills with <a href="/wiki/Anthrax" title="Anthrax">Anthrax</a>. Sam has an opportunity to bring an injured hostage or Jules to safety and, choosing to observe the Priority of Life Code, saves the hostage. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to the rest of the team, Greg Parker has been suspended by Dr. Toth for concealing Jules and Sam's relationship. Greg and Dr. Toth watch the code being observed over a video feed, and Dr. Toth later tells Sam he will talk to Commander Holleran and try to allow them to stay on Team One together. At the end of Season 4 they receive the news that they're both allowed to stay on Team One together while being in a relationship. In "We Take Care of Our Own", it's revealed that Jules is pregnant with Sam's baby. As of "Keep the Peace (Part 1)", Sam and Jules are married. In "Keep the Peace (Part 2)", a year later, their daughter Sadie is born and Sam is leader of Team Three.</dd>

He is a constantly happy and optimistic young man who is always willing to help others and is deeply touched by his job. He lives with his Mother and Father and is quite pleased to be incredibly in touch with his Italian heritage and speaks the language fluently. He was nicknamed 'Spike' because of his usually 'spikey' hair.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>He and Lou were best friends and frequently paired on the field; they even made a leisure trip to <a href="/wiki/Ocho_Rios" title="Ocho Rios">Ocho Rios</a> together. Spike tried to save Lou's life when he stepped on the landmine, however was unsuccessful. Lou's death had enormous adverse effects on Spike, as seen in several episodes following his death.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the finale of Season 3 'Fault Lines', it is revealed that Spike's Father is sick and dying with no hope at survival. His father is also furious and ashamed that his son is in the SRU and won't speak or make any attempt at a relationship with him until he quits. In 'Shockwave' (4x07) while attempting to disarm a bomb that would destroy an enormous part of downtown Toronto, he gets a call from his Mother. She is at the hospital with his Father - he took a turn for the worse and isn't expected to live the night. Although terribly conflicted, Spike decides to stay on the call and manages to disarm the massive bomb with seconds to spare. After hugs from his team, Spike rushes to the hospital and is greeted by his Mother who bursts into tears at the sight of him. He sits by his Father's bedside and listens to him as he finally confesses: "Michelangelo, I'm scared." to which Spike grasps his hand and replies: "It's okay, I'm here. We're all here.". It is revealed in a later episode that his father did die.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Spike is shocked when Greg quits in the middle of the finale of Season 4, saying: "Guys, did that just happen?" from the control room in apparent disbelief. He is overjoyed when Greg decides to stay on the Team as he is very loyal and hates to see the team being broken up. This is proved in 'The Good Citizen' when Greg confronts Spike about a branch of the Federal Government coming to speak to him about recruiting Spike. He is wanted by several different agencies and, as pointed out by Wordy in 'Fault Lines' "Can pick up and leave whenever he wants.". However, Spike decides to remain with the team showing that although leaving would advance his career, he remains loyal to the SRU and Team One. In Season 5, episode 4 "Eyes In", Spike tries asking Winnie out, which she turns down, admitting that she doesn't date cops because she needs balance in her life, not as a fake rule to let guys down easy. She implies that if it weren't an unbreakable rule, she'd break it for him saying "the perfect guy just came along." In the series finale, "Keep the Peace", a year later, Spike and Winnie officially become a couple.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The wife of Ed Lane, they have been married for seventeen years. Mother to Clark Lane and Isabel Lane. Sophie is generally a very supportive spouse, and puts up with Ed's heavy workload for much of the marriage. However, her patience for this lessened during her pregnancy with Izzy. The first real indication that she was unhappy came during the events of 'Unconditional Love', where Ed's brother, Roy, disobeys an order to hang back, and his partner is killed. Ed was supposed to have been with Sophie for her first sonogram, but goes with the team to respond to the call, much to her frustration and disappointment. Sophie eventually makes the decision to leave Ed for the duration of her pregnancy, and takes Clark with her. In "I'd Do Anything", Ed reveals to Greg that Sophie has issued an ultimatum: he must choose between the family and the job. Later in "Fault Lines", Sophie goes into labor while Team 1 is undergoing their routine requalification and psychological evaluations. It is a very difficult labor for Sophie and the baby is in distress. Ed leaves in the middle of his psych evaluation to be with his wife. On the way to the hospital, Ed is shot in an apparent case of road rage. He refuses treatment in order to be with Sophie who is waiting for a c-section, because baby Issy is in fetal distress. Ed makes promises to both Sophie, Issy that he'll be there for them after having almost lost both of them during the delivery. After 5 months of therapy, healing and being a husband and father again Ed returns to the SRU to turn in his badge, but Sophie stops him knowing that the SRU is part of who he is. She states what she needs from him (no overtime, no pre-shift workouts, et al.) and for Ed to be on baby duty on his time off, so she can start a catering business. Ed is beyond happy as is the team to have him back as Team One's Team Leader. Sophie's final appearance is in 'Keep the Peace, Pt. 2', as she learns that her son, Clark, has been caught in one of the bombings. Ed is able to find him, and he reassures her that while Clark is hurt, he's safe.</dd>
