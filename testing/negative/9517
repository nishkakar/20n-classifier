Brix and Bora say they view the Great Web as an eternal game, a competition to see who can kill the most Totems. Jennix says he sees the Web as a puzzle to be solved as the Weaver told him that he would never unravel its secrets. Daemos responds that he views the Web as a license for debauchery, as the Master Weaver informed him that he would perish before his father and he wants to enjoy what life he had left to the fullest. Morlun responds that as Solus' chosen heir, the Great Web is his legacy and obligation. Solus says the Web is all things and everywhere and that it is their kingdom, making them the Inheritors of All Creation.

<p>On Earth-13, Spider-Man asks why he is special and is told it is because he is the only one who faced an Inheritor and won. Spider-UK gets a reading on the second team and Old Man Spider-Man says they need to act quickly to recruit them. Peter insists Spider-Woman of Earth-65 stay behind. Old Man Spider-Man gives Spider-Man one of their devices to travel the Great Web and tells him to pick a team. He chooses Miguel, Spider-Woman and Silk, but Old Man Spider insists Silk remain behind, refusing to say why. Silk waits until they have gone through the portal and then follows.</p>
<p>The group arrive on Earth-928, and Peter is horrified to see the Superior Spider-Man leading this group of Spider-Men. Spider-Woman and Kaine also recognize Superior Spider-Man. Spider-Man explains that Superior Spider-Man had been time-displaced. Old Man Spider-Man is perplexed that Superior Spider-Man is from Earth-616 and angry that Silk disobeyed orders. Superior Spider-Man is furious about their arrival interrupting his work on a device to hide them from the Inheritors. Old Man Spider-Man tries to explain that Kaine and Silk are the receptacles of the Other and the Bride, but Superior Spider-Man dismisses his talk of Totems as superstition. Daemos emerges from a portal and kills Spider-Cyborg. During the brawl, Miles recognizes Spider-Man and is confused at there being two of him, while Spider-Girl of Earth-982 and Kaine bicker over who will be the one to kill Daemos. Superior Spider-Man manages to kill Daemos. Spider-Man is surprised that Daemos's body does not disintegrate as Morlun did when Spider-Man last killed him. Spider-Man 2099 says the Superior Spider-Man used 2099 technology to put Daemos' corpse in stasis. Superior Spider-Man blames Silk for the Inheritor's attack and suggests they kill her. Old Man Spider-Man interrupts, saying he is the only one who knows what is going on. Before he can explain, a portal opens and a second Daemos snaps his neck. Brix and Bora step through as well. In the ensuing chaos, Assassin Spider-Man is killed. Kaine and Ben Reilly deduce that the Inheritors are clones (explaining why their bodies disintegrate upon death) and Ben opens a portal to the Inheritors' home base. Ultimate Spider-Woman (now going by the name Black Widow) joins them stating she is a clone as well. Spider-UK opens a portal to Earth-13 for the rest to escape. The dying Old Man Spider calls out to Spider-Man, revealing himself to be <a href="/wiki/Ezekiel_(comics)" title="Ezekiel (comics)">Ezekiel Sims</a> from Earth-4 (where Morlun killed that world's Spider-Man) and tells Peter to protect the Scion, the Bride, and the Other at all costs. Silk steals Spider-Man's portal device, intending to set right the deaths she caused and opens a portal while attracting the Inheritors' attention. Spider-Woman volunteers to follow Silk while Superior Spider-Man sends Spider-Man Noir to accompany them. Brix notes that the Spiders have Daemos' old body, but says he will retrieve it himself and sends them after the Bride. When they arrive on Earth-13, Spider-Man is met by an angry Superior Spider-Man, who announces they are at war with the Inheritors and from this point on, he is in charge.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Spider-Man challenges Superior Spider-Man, claiming he has more experience with the Inheritors. Superior Spider-Man says he is from later in their timeline, and knows everything Peter does. Otto challenges Peter to prove why he should lead, but Spider-Man shuts him up by punching him in the face. As they fight, Superior Spider-Man sneers at Spider-Man for not being ruthless enough to kill his opponents. This causes Spider-Man to realize Otto thinks Peter is from before the mind-swap took place, not after. Taking advantage of this, Spider-Man challenges Superior Spider-Man to prove his superiority and kill him. Unwilling to create a time paradox and risk his existence, Superior Spider-Man backs down. Spider-Man tells Superior Spider-Man that since the Inheritors cannot die, killing is not the solution.</p>
<p>On Earth-13989, Karn slays a <a href="/wiki/Werewolf" title="Werewolf">werewolf</a> version of Spider-Man called Spider-Wolf and asks Solus if he can finally return home. Solus commands the Master Weaver to send Karn to another more challenging world. Then Solus mocks Morlun's fear of the Spider-Man of Earth-616. Morlun says he is concerned about the prophecy and that "the Other," "the Bride," and "the Scion" have all manifested. Solus agrees they could end the Inheritors' reign, but rebukes him when Morlun says the Scion still lies outside their reach. Solus calls for Jennix to join them, claiming it is time to crush the Spiders' last hope.</p>
<p>On Earth-13, Spider-Man tells Superior Spider-Man he respects his expertise and would be a fool not to seek his advice. Checking with their away teams, Peter gets no response from Kaine's group, and is brushed off by Spider-Man 2099. Spider-UK reports Spider-Man Noir was badly injured and Spider-Woman and Silk have taken him to die on his home world. Superior Spider-Man expresses concern since the Inheritors have already been there, but Spider-Man says Silk should be safe as long as she keeps moving and takes one of Superior Spider-Man's cloaking devices. Superior Spider-Man says he has located the Inheritors' homeworld, but they need a stronger army. Peter asks Spider-Girl and Spider-Woman of Earth-65 to help him gather recruits. Spider-Woman of Earth-65 is surprised he picked her and Spider-Man apologizes for his prior over protectiveness. He confesses he failed to save the Gwen Stacy of his world and in turn, she tells him of her failure to save the Peter of her world. They agree to watch each other's backs. Peter sends Miles Morales and <a href="/wiki/Ultimate_Spider-Man_(TV_series)" title="Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)">Animated Spider-Man</a> to gather more troops.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/Spider-Man_(1967_TV_series)" title="Spider-Man (1967 TV series)">Earth-67</a>, Miles and Animated Spider-Man are disturbed by the pastel-colored palette and repetitive backgrounds. Animated Spider-Man remarks it feels like they are in a cartoon from the 1960s, and abruptly transforms into a super-deformed version of himself in a <a href="/wiki/Hippie" title="Hippie">hippie</a> costume. When Miles expresses surprise, Animated Spider-Man reverts to normal and sheepishly admits he has an overactive imagination. Making their way to the <i>Daily Bugle</i>, they arrive just as J.

<p>On Earth-13, May, Benjy, Captain Universe, Spider-Punk, and SP//dr detect an ominous sensation in their spider-senses. Morlun and Jennix emerge from portals, and as Captain Universe prepares to destroy them Solus emerges and commands his sons to attack. Moving faster than the Spiders can react, Morlun kills <a href="/wiki/Flash_Thompson" title="Flash Thompson">Captain Spider</a> and Jennix kills Spider-Monkey of <a href="/wiki/Marvel_Apes" title="Marvel Apes">Earth-8101</a>. Cosmic Spider-Man angrily smites the Jennix, declaring that he will put an end to them. Solus mocks his ignorance and tells him that they conquered mortality ages ago.</p>
<p>On Earth-802, Jennix regenerates from a clone fetus. He declines to return to the battlefield complaining that eating a <a href="/wiki/Monkey" title="Monkey">monkey</a> is hardly worth his time and returns to his research.

<p>Back on Earth-13, Solus engages Cosmic Spider-Man while Spider-UK contacts Spider-Man, telling him to return immediately. Solus reveals the Enigma Force is pure life force energy on which the Inheritors feed and devours Cosmic Spider-Man. He tells the Spiders that nowhere is safe for them, then commands Morlun to claim their prize. Morlun takes Benjy Parker from Spider-Girl of Earth-982, declaring him to be the receptacle of the Scion, while Spider-Girl of Earth-982 looks on in horror.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>On Earth-13, Solus and Morlun have reclaimed the Scion, Benjy Parker. The Spider-Totems surround both Inheritors and Spider-Punk says they are screwed. Superior Spider-Man shuts him and tells him that killing Captain Universe might have weakened him and it might be their only chance to attack their leader. Spider-Girl of Earth-982 protests since Morlun has her brother but the Spider-Totems charge at Solus, who mocks them for thinking him weakened while he had consumed the greatest life force of that dimension and never felt more alive, killing the Prince of Arachne and Arachnosaurus easily as Morlun tells the Master Weaver to spin him a way home. May tries to stop him but Morlun punches her away and goes through the portal with the crying Benjy, much to May's horror. Spider-UK calls Spider-Man and tells him that they lost the Safe Zone. He tells him that they are coming but had to do some stops and Spider-UK asks him where he has been. Then Spider-Man, Spider-Woman of Earth-65, Spider-Girl, Mangaverse Spider-Man, and Spider-Man J arrive and Anya and <a href="/wiki/Spider-Gwen" title="Spider-Gwen">Spider-Gwen</a> tell him that they were in three different <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japans</a>. Spider-UK asks why and Peter tells him they got a strong reading to a totem and then opens a portal to <a href="/wiki/Spider-Man_(Toei_TV_series)" title="Spider-Man (Toei TV series)">Takuya Yamashiro</a>, the Spider-Man of Earth-51778 who happens to have a giant robot Leopardon, which Takuya charges against Solus. Solus is unimpressed and with the Enigman Force, he absorbed Leopardon. Solus also rips its arm before it can counterattack while Spider-UK tells them that they have to pull back. Spider-Girl of Earth-982 tells him that they have to stop Solus, who knows where is here brother. They open the portal and Superior Spider-Man congratulates Spider-Man for making a choice like leaving a men behind for the rest. Spider-Man tells him that he has a plan and swears to Spider-Girl of Earth-982 that they will find Benjy but that it's not safe there anymore. As they leave, Solus tells him that it's not safe anywhere. Meanwhile, Silk has arrived to Earth-3145 while on the run from Brix and Bora. The radioactive air starts to affect her and the twins arrive. When Brix steps out of the portal, he screams in pain as radiation is lethal to his kind and Bora gets him out. Realizing that the irradiated world hurts them more than her, Silk decides to take it. She covers herself in isolated web and realizes she knows where to go.</p>
<p>The Spider-Army arrives on Earth-8847, which has a prehistoric-like appearance. Spider-Man says he transported them randomly since the Inheritors will not know where they are if they do not know themselves, until they find a new safe zone. Superior Spider-Man tells him that he has cost them his base, their refuge and both Leopardon and Supaidāman. Supaidāman appears from a portal and tells them that he escaped at the cost of Leopardon. Mangaverse Spider-Man and Spider-Man J console Supaidāman in Japanese and tell him that he is not alone. Spider-Man tries to talk to Spider-Girl of Earth-982, but she tells him that she is done listening to them and that there's only one real Spider-Man: her dad, and he is dead. Peter then gets a call from Spider-Woman, who has infiltrated the Inheritors' house by impersonating her Earth-001 counterpart. She tells him that she had to change devices with Silk after she damaged hers and does not have enough charge to talk for long or to make a portal big enough for her. Spider-Man asks her if she needs one of them to come for her but she tells him that she is good and that her Earth-001 counterpart is part of the Inheritors' help. Peter comments that it is very convenient and the Master Weaver comments that it's almost like if it were planned as part a grand design. Peter loses her signal and contacts Miles and asks him how does the recruitment goes. He responds that he has no words as he, 67' Spider-Man and Animated Spider-Man were joined by a <a href="/wiki/Cowboy" title="Cowboy">cowboy</a> Spider-Man, Mini Marvels Spider-Man, an unknown Spider-Man and a sentient Spider-Mobile. The Spider-Mobile tells him to open the portal as Animated Spider-Man calls them the Web Warriors, much to Miles' annoyance. Peter calls Miguel and Lady Spider at Earth-928 as they dissect Daemos' corpse while he is trapped by Alchemax. Miguel tells him that if the Inheritors have a weakness, they will find it and that they have discovered more of their cloning process. Before he can tell him more, Jennix cuts the transmition from Earth-802 and tells Peter that he can hear everything that they have been saying. Jennix tells him that they have been moving and speaking across the dimensional threads of the Great Web and his family mastered this centuries ago. Peter asks him why would he show his hand and Jennix tells him that watching them has been amusing but he cannot have them share tactical info. He sends Vern their cordinates and she arrives with her Hounds Rhino, <a href="/wiki/Ox_(comics)" title="Ox (comics)">Ox</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Hammerhead_(comics)" title="Hammerhead (comics)">Hammerhead</a>. The Spiders battle the Hounds as Verna wounds <a href="/wiki/Betty_Brant" title="Betty Brant">Spider-Girl</a> of Earth-78227 to Sp//r's horror.</p>
<p>On Earth-001, the Master Weaver tells a disguised Spider-Woman that Solus has forced him to reveal skeins that are yet to come, knowledge that has helped them gain dominion of reality, but small acts of rebellion, seemingly insignificant threads he will do when no one was looking, can change the design, like that very moment and Spider-Woman's counterpart. All made so that he can give her the prophecies. These contain all they need to know of the Other, the Bride and the Scion and something else. The Master Weaver tells her that his masters plan to do more than kill all the spiders and to hurry as they approach. Morlun gives Benjy to Brix and Bora, causing the latter to protest. Morlun mocks their failure to catch the Bride and tells them to hold the Scion. He salutes Jessica, who transported away the scrolls the Master Weaver gave her.</p>
<p>At Earth-8847, Spider-Man receives the scrolls during the fight attached to Spider-Woman's teleporter. Otto and Anya ask him what's their next move and Silk calls him. She tells him to get to Earth-3145 before Jennix blocks her. Peter opens the portal and they follow when they notice that Verna will not get near it. In Earth-3145, Superior Spider-Man tells Spider-Girl to give him an atmosphere reading and she tells him that the radiation are extremely toxic. Superior Spider-Man screams at Spider-Man for bringing them there, but Spider-Man India notices webbed arrows left by Cindy. They follow the trail to Earth-3145's Sims Tower. They go to the bunker of the tower and Spider-Man tells them that it's designed to hide them form the Inheritors. Inside, they found Silk, who tells them the Earth-3145's spider-totem was already in there when she got there. That totem is then revealed to be that world's Uncle Ben.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>On Earth-001, the Inheritors convene and Jennix apologizes to Solus for failing to stop the destruction of the cloning facility. Brix and Bora reveal that the Spiders have taken refuge on Earth-3145, the one world they cannot go to. Solus dismisses them saying that as long as they have the Scion, the Bride and the Other will come to them stating that it is time to exterminate the Spider-Totems once and for all.</p>
<p>On Earth-3145, Uncle Ben explains that after being bitten by the spider, he became his world's Spider-Man, wearing a costume from his nephew. All went well until his nemesis the Emerald Elf (this world's version of Green Goblin) figured out who he was and bombed the Parker household, killing May and Peter. Ben quit being Spider-Man, and when Ezekiel Sims told him he was in danger from Morlun, accepted his offer to stay in the bunker.</p>
<p>Spider-Man and Superior Spider-Man press Ben for further details as to why he let the world fall into ruin, and Ben reveals that his world's Doctor Octopus held the world at ransom with nuclear weapons, but there had been a mistake and the device detonated prematurely. While Superior Spider-Man expresses disbelief and dismay at his counterpart's actions, Peter takes out the scrolls Spider-Woman sent them. Silk, feeling guilty for having gotten Spider-Woman trapped, sneaks away, but is tailed by Spider-Woman of Earth-65 who offers to join her in a rescue mission.</p>
<p>Pavitr Prabhakar and Spider-UK have an existential discussion, with the former taking note of the overwhelming number of similarities between himself and the other Spider-Totems, especially the Peter Parker of Earth-616. Pavitr states that it feels like he and the others are echoes or distorted reflections of Earth-616 Peter, and therefore expendable in the coming battle. Spider-UK refutes this stating that while there are thousands of members in the Captain Britain Corps, each one is unique and special in their own way.</p>
<p>Angered by the actions of his counterpart and frustrated by the others' inability to translate the Master Weaver's scrolls, Superior Spider-Man furiously snatches the scroll away and activates his holographic assistant. When Spider-Man notes that it has a striking resemblance to Anna Maria Marconi, Superior Spider-Man abruptly realizes that Spider-Man is from later in the Earth-616 timeline and therefore that he regains control of his body, with Superior Spider-Man losing everything. Before he can do anything, Spider-Girl reveals that due to her original powers having come from a cult that worships the Master Weaver, she can read the text, stating that the first scroll contains a prophecy that the Inheritors will lose to the Spiders in 1000 years in the future, and that the only way of averting this fate is by sacrificing the Other, the Bride, and the Scion, which will stop new totems from existing. Spider-Girl of Earth-982 furiously demands they travel to Earth-001 and rescue her brother. At that point, the Spiders realize that Cindy has run off again. Spider-Man contacts her to find her in the middle of a brawl with multiversal pirates, one of whom destroys her teleporter.</p>
<p>On Earth-802, Kaine angrily rebukes Black Widow of Earth-1610's attempts to console him over Ben's sacrifice, traveling to Earth-001. The Inheritors, sensing the presence of the Other and the Bride, go on the offensive. On Earth-3145, Spider-Girl states they can use the contents of the second scroll which contains Karn's life story to sway him to their side and turn things in the Spiders' favor. Spider-Man contacts Kaine, who reveals he is on Loomworld and intends to kill the Inheritors himself before tapping into the Other's full power. Spider-Man contacts his away teams, ordering them to rendezvous at Earth-001 ASAP, shouting down Spider-Man 2099's protests. Black Widow of Earth-1610 reveals that she's stuck at Jennix's base, but Miles calls in and says his squad will pick her up.</p>
<p>On Earth-001, Kaine transforms into a massive Man-Spider as the Inheritors arrive. Morlun remarks that the last time he faced the Other, when it was hosted by Spider-Man. Morlun states that it was nowhere near as powerful and Solus remarks it is due to it being in the Center of Reality. The Other impales Solus on multiple spines mid-boast, killing him. Morlun attacks in a rage, ripping off one of the Other's legs and stabbing it through the head, stating that they do not need it alive, only its blood.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Black Widow of Earth-1610 berates Silk for destroying two teleporters in a single day. Gwen tries to break up the argument, but Verna, Brix, and Bora attack with their Hounds consisting of a <a href="/wiki/Hobgoblin_(comics)" title="Hobgoblin (comics)">Hobgoblin</a> and multiple Green Goblins.</p>
<p>On Earth-3145, Spider-Girl of Earth-982 snaps at Spider-Man to leave Uncle Ben (who refuses to suit up) behind. Despite Ben dejectedly remarking that Spider-Girl of Earth-982 is right, Spider-Man reminds him that "with great power must also come great responsibility" revealing that he kept the costume and stating that his Uncle Ben made all the difference. Superior Spider-Man angrily snaps at Ben to toughen up, stating that he lost more times than he won but that did not keep him from fighting. Superior Spider-Man's rant inspires Ben to put the costume on one last time and the Spider-Army sets off for the final battle.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>With most of all surviving Spiders, and a now redeemed Karn heading to Loomworld for the final battle to save Benjy, Silk, and those whose with them to stop Inheritors, Spider-Ham disguise as Benjy to trick Morlun from feeding the child, after Ben Parker took Benjy safely to another dimension, which is Mayday and Benjy's home reality. Meanwhile, Superior Spider-Man had his own plan to put an end the Inheritors' reign by killing the Master Weaver and succeeds by breaking his neck instead causing the Inheritors to be unable to go after more Spider-Totems. However, the Master Weaver's death cause the fabric of reality and its history's destruction much to Morlun and original Spider-Man's horror. While holding a crystal that contains Solus' soul from Jennix and when Daemos ask her to kill him as a revenge, Spider-Girl of Earth-982 tells him that what she's only follows her father's heroic path of justice, because heroes don't kill. With most of Inheritors lost the fight and transported to Earth-3145 safe for Karn (who sided with the Spiders), Morlun still enraged and attack Spider-Man to kill him for ruining their plans. Instead, Spider-Man took Morlun with him to Earth-3145, then escapes thanks to Silk, after leaving him and his Inheritors' companions a tip to get them safe on Sims Tower and never come back as a threat. With the Inheritors no longer a threat, the Spider Army needs a rest for a few minutes until most of them finally home to their respective universes.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>On Earth-802 (an Earth ruled by Jennix of the Inheritors), Tony Stark was the architect of three of its biggest cities. When Spider-Man of Earth-94, Scarlet Spider, and Black Widow of Earth-1610 traveled to this reality and encountered a factory of clones, Iron Man was attracted by the disturbances created by the arachnid heroes. Iron Man attempted to apprehend them aware that bringing three spider-heroes would guarantee him a high reward from Jennix, but he was taken by surprise by the Scarlet Spider and knocked out when the faceplate of his armor was up. Black Widow dismantled the armor and interrogated Stark for the location of Jennix which was revealed to be the Baxter Building. Spider-Man would later wear Stark's Iron Man armor to impersonate him and gain easy access to the Baxter Building.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> When Spider-Man of Earth-94, Scarlet Spider, and Black Widow of Earth-1610 infiltrate the Baxter Building and have their encounters with this reality's versions of <a href="/wiki/Jackal_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Jackal (Marvel Comics)">Miles Warren</a> and Johnny Storm (who mistook Kaine for this reality's version of Peter Parker), they run into Jennix. As part of Jennix's "special projects," he revealed to the Spiders that he has attempted to clone numerous Spider-Men from across the Multiverse, in an attempt to create a livestock of spider-totems to consume. However, his experiments had failed because he was not able to clone the essence of the spider (which the Inheritors feasted on) into the cloned body.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> After facing Jennix, Spider-Man of Earth-94 set out to destroy the device which received the signal that carried the Inheritors to their new bodies.

At the same time they had captured the new Daemos and locked him up in a stasis. But this was not able to hold him like Miguel originally thought, Daemos used the field to his advantage where he killed himself so another clone could be transported back there with his essence uploaded into it to finish off the two spiders. But as Daemos made his way to Alchemax, he was blasted off the flying vehicle by the Punisher 2099. Jake confronted Daemos with his advanced weapons dealing a good amount of damage to Daemos, going as far as beating him repeatedly in the face with a titanium baseball bat and using a plasma gas cannon to burn the ground causing Daemos to fall through. Jake's distraction gave Spider-Man 2099 and Lady Spider of Earth-803 the ample time to transport back to the spider safe zone.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>On Earth-803 in 1895, May Reilly's father kept numerous animals in his study. One of these animals was a spider. One day, May Reilly opened the spider's cage so it could get comfort as she believed it to be upset for its captivity. May then tried to pet the spider and as soon as her hand got near, the spider bit her. According to May, the spider taught her an important lesson which was not to let anyone cage you. After her father died, May used spare parts of his garage to create a suit with four mechanical arms which enabled her to climb walls. She also created mechanical web-shooters. During a ball May was attending, Electro took the mayor hostage. May used this as the opportunity to debut as the Lady Spider. She confronted Electro and webbed him up. However, soon the rest of the Six Men of Sinestry (which also consisted of Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Kraven the Hunter, Mysterio, and Vulture) arrived. After taking some plans the mayor had hidden in his tuxedo, the Six Men of Sinestry were forced to retreat due to the opposition Lady Spider posed for them.

Returning to the ruins of her home, Spider-Girl of Earth-982 encounters Ben Parker from Earth-3145 who reveals that Mary Jane and Wes survived Daemos' attack.

On Loomworld, the remainder of the Spider-Army says their goodbyes. Miles Morales laments that he and Spider-Man didn't get to spend more time together and Peter jokingly states that they'll meet again suggesting that they hang out in Earth-616 next time. Spider-Punk of Earth-138 tells Spider-UK to keep an eye on Karn stating that while he may seem reformed, he still killed a lot of Spiders. When only Spider-UK, Spider-Woman of Earth-65, Spider-Man 2099, and the Spiders from Earth-616 remain, Peter prepares to say goodbye to Spider-Man 2099 when their Spider Senses collectively overwhelm them with agony. Karn realizes someone is tampering with the Web of Life and Destiny and they rush to the web to find Superior Spider-Man hacking at the Web with Morlun's dagger. When Karn shouts that he could destroy the Multiverse, Superior Spider-Man sneers that he's aware of his destiny and tries to reject his fate, revealing that he figured out that Peter Parker from his universe is from the future.</p>
<p>On Earth-616, <a href="/wiki/Julia_Carpenter" title="Julia Carpenter">Julia Carpenter</a> awakens from her coma and shouts that the Great Web is being destroyed and that she can see nothing of the future. As Superior Spider-Man continues to cut the threads, Karn states that at any moment he could erase them from existence and Spider-UK states they're losing portals home. Peter tells Spider-Woman of Earth-65 and Spider-Man 2099 to head to their home dimensions before it's too late while he leads the Earth-616 Spiders against Superior Spider-Man. Spider-Woman of Earth-65 complains that she never found out how the story ended. Spider-Man 2099 reveals to her that in the end Peter takes his body back from Doctor Octopus and the good guys win.</p>
<p>Superior Spider-Man battles with Spider-Woman and Spider-Girl stating that by destroying the Web, he's giving them free will. When Anya sees there's totemic script on the dagger, Superior Spider-Man attempts to stab her before being punched away by Spider-Man. Superior Spider-Man sneers that Spider-Man is a coward for ganging up on him, but Spider-Man points out that he did the same thing as the founder of the Sinister Six. Taking advantage of the distraction, Spider-Girl immobilizes Superior Spider-Man's arm and reads that there will always be a Master Weaver at the center of the Great Web. Silk recalls that the Inheritors referred to her as the "Spinner at the center of the Web" and wonders if her destiny is to take the Master Weaver's place. While Superior Spider-Man again tries to stab Spider-Girl, he snaps that his world needs him and that he's the greatest Spider-Man ever. Spider-Man and Spider-Woman knock him back, and Spider-Girl secures the dagger reading that anyone can take the place of the current Master Weaver, but only death can free the Master Weaver from their sacred obligation. Silk, having spent most of her life trapped in one room, balks at the idea of spending the rest of eternity trapped again and Karn commiserates with her.</p>
<p>Superior Spider-Man accuses Spider-Man and Spider-Woman of hypocritically claiming to fight for freedom while trying to lock him on a fixed path that ends in his death. Peter snaps that it was Superior Spider-Man himself that set the path in motion. Silk resolves to take the Master Weaver's place, unmasking him and expressing confusion at not recognizing his identity. Karn states that he finally knows who the Master Weaver is and unmasks himself revealing that he and the Master Weaver are one and the same. Superior Spider-Man punches Spider-Woman away, challenging Spider-Man to a one-on-one duel to see who the better hero is. Spider-Man retorts that a real hero wouldn't have tried to murder Spider-Girl or destroy the Multiverse in order to save himself, revealing that Superior Spider-Man will understand what it means to be a true hero when he willingly sacrifices himself and gives up their body of his own free will.</p>
<p>Analyzing the Master Weaver's armor, Karn notices a slot that fits the prongs of the spear he made as a child, which acts as a key to open the mechanism. When Silk asks how he could possibly be in two places at once, Karn states that the flow of time differs in Earth-001, using the coexistence of Spider-Man and Superior Spider-Man as an example. When Spider-Girl states that only a Spider Totem should be able to repair the web, Karn states that he's consumed enough Totems for their essence to enable him to take the Master Weaver's place, donning the Master Weaver's mask and stating that this shall be his penance and hopefully salvation. Spider-Man defeats Superior Spider-Man who feigns surrender, but puts Anna on a 100-day standby. Spider-Girl asks Karn if he can repair the damage done by the Inheritors and Superior Spider-Man. Karn states that in time he can fix the web, but that in the meantime all the Spiders' connections to it will be diminished where it will weaken their Spider-Senses.</p>
<p>As Karn prepares to return him to the past, Superior Spider-Man swears revenge on him, to which Karn dryly retorts that he already got by killing his future self. As Superior Spider-Man swears that he'll find a way to survive, Spider-Man shoves him through the portal and he reappears in the aftermath of the chronoton implosion that time-displaced him in the first place, his memory of the recent events erased. Karn remarks that weaving and repairing the Great Web is new to him, but that the existence of Earth-616 has been stabilized. Karn reveals that Spider-UK's dimension Earth-833 was destroyed. Spider-UK reveals that Incursions between dimensions have been erasing entire realities lamenting that he wasn't able to help his fellow corpsmen face the danger. The Earth-616 Spiders console him, reminding him that without his efforts they wouldn't have stood a chance against the Inheritors. When Silk asks if the Inheritors will be able to survive on Earth-3145 without draining the essence of Spider-Totems, Karn remarks that his family can subsist off the life force of any animal and that Earth-3145 is teeming with mutant spiders.</p>
<p>Spider-Man laments at the loss of Kaine gazing at the Other's corpse and stating that he deserved better than to die a monster. Spider-UK states that all the lost Spider-Totems deserved to live volunteering to travel the Multiverse and protect the worlds that lost their Spider-Totems. Spider-Girl volunteers to join him much to Spider-Woman's surprise. Karn dubs them the Warriors of the Great Web and charges them with helping him repair the severed thread. When Spider-Girl wonders if they can do it alone, Spider-UK remarks they made a number of Amazing Friends as images of Mayday Parker of Earth-982 (who is now dubbed as Spider-Woman), Spider-Ham, Spider-Man Noir, Pavitr Prabhakar, and Spider-Woman of Earth-65 appear in the Web of Life.</p>
<p>Karn opens a portal to Earth-616 and the Spiders bid farewell with Spider-Woman fussing over Spider-Girl and Spider-Man teasing Spider-UK one last time. After they depart, Karn offers the Warriors of the Great Web a tour of the Inheritor's palace. Unbeknown to them, a hand erupts from the Other's corpse revealing that Kaine is still alive.</p>
<p>On Earth-616, Silk realizes they've been gone for days and hopes the Fact Channel hasn't fired her. Spider-Woman remarks that as his own boss, Peter doesn't need to worry about such things. Spider-Man corrects her stating that for a long time, he didn't feel ready to run his own company. But that after leading the Spider-Army, he feels ready for anything.
